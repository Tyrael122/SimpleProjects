A simple project of a telephone book made in C#.
It has 6 options: to add a contact, to change, to delete, to search, to list and to import or export from a file.
It takes the contacts from a file called "contatosTelefone.txt". The path was where it was in my PC, edit it as you please. 

As it was made as an assignment from college, the comments are in portuguese.
